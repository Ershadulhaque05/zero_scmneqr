Title: EFFICIENT QUANTUM IMAGE REPRESENTATION AND COMPRESSION CIRCUIT USING ZERO-DISCARDED STATE PREPARATION APPROACH

Abstract: Quantum image computing has emerged as a
groundbreaking field, revolutionizing how we store and process
data at speeds incomparable to classical methods. Nevertheless, as
image sizes expand, so does the complexity of qubit connections,
posing significant challenges in the efficient representation and
compression of quantum images. In response, we introduce a
transformative approach known as Zero-Discarded State Connec-
tion for Enhanced Quantum Representation (ZSCNEQR). This
innovative strategy streamlines circuit complexity by eliminating
zero connection from the state connection information. In our
operational control gates, only the input ’1’ impacts the output,
allowing us to discard zero connections and dramatically enhance
the efficiency of our circuit design. As a result, the proposed
approach significantly reduces the number of gates required for
both image compression and representation. Our findings reveal
that ZSCNEQR requires an impressive 44.21% fewer gates than
existing techniques, such as the Direct Cosine Transform Efficient
Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (DCT-EFRQI), all
while maintaining a consistent peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).
For an image block size of 2Sx × 2Sy with q gray levels, the
complexity of our approach can be succinctly expressed as:
O[3q + log2 Sx + log2 Sy + q · 2(log2 Sx+log2 Sy )]
Here, Sx and Sy represent the X and Y positional control
gates, while q indicates the non-zero transform coefficients.
Moreover, experimental evaluations strongly demonstrate that
ZSCNEQR excels in both compressing and representing quantum
images compared to the DCT-EFRQI approach, particularly
excelling in the essential metrics of gate requirements and PSNR
performance. Embrace the future of quantum imaging with our
innovative solution—where efficiency meets excellence.
